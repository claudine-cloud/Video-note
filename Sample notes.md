### This are my thoughts what we have shared in our meeting.


## *Good day!*

_*About using **Git Hub** for my understanding is a cloud based where you can stored the repository using git. To create the project you must create your username to GitHub then download the editor where you going to create the text file and  created repository it can be GUI, Back end and front of API. This context in terminal can converted into website, application interface, designing using codes  you need to use some language  to create the application. There is a lot of language that can be use but in different coding's or syntax (not sure about this)*._


**I do believe that this is very challenging role because it is different variety and  you need to be keen on details regarding inputting the right command in line, syntax and fix the bug and analyze the prompt error.**

_When I was in college I'd never focus in programming because I do believe  that you have to be smart, analytic and very meticulous works but the time goes by in this generation is really advantage even the grade school can learn._


<ls>
I found out last night that you are a great teacher to your people because the way you spoke very detailed and always sharing your ideas and knowledge about what have you learned. I know it is the beginning but i do believe it is not easy to adapt the programming language and i hope you understand about it.
